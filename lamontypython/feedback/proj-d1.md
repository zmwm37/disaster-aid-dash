## Project - Deliverable \# 1 Feedback 
 
First, I appreciate the naming of the team. I'm always for clever pun (haha).

Second, great idea for a project! I feel its all doable but I might suggest that you select a few U.S. cities to make the management of the front-end UI easier to implement. Your potential data sources look good and overall the complexity is just right. Keep going!
